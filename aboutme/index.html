    <h2>Edy</h2>
    <p>Hi to all! My name is Edgar, but some people call me Edy. I'm studying
         at BYU Idaho to get a degree in Software development. In my free 
         time, I like to read books, watch sci-fi movies, and play video 
         games. I'm married and have 2 children and a dog. I work for an 
         automotive company where I provide support for a Software System 
         used to control Sales activities, but I want to learn how to code 
         to get involved in other activities.
    </p>
    <p>The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is that it lets me work 
        full-time and study. That's one reason that helped me decide 
        to get a bachelor's degree. I think learning web design will 
        give me the opportunity to get another job in the future.
    </p>

        I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day 
        Saints for 35 years. One of my favorite scriptures from a Church 
        leader is “No other success in life can compensate for failure 
        in the home” (David O. McKay).
