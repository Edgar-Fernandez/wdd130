                    <h3>Restrictions</h3>
                    <p>Since the temporary building will be used by two wards at the same time, it is recommended to use
                        public
                        transport to get to the Ixtazihualt building because parking spots are limited. Internet
                        connectivity is
                        also limited due to the location of the building and the services available in Santa Maria
                        Atexcac.
                        Public
                        transport is available only from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Rooms inside the building are small and
                        no
                        air
                        conditioning is available inside the building. There won't be an office for Huejotzingo Ward
                        leaders
