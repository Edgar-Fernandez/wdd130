        are going to face to execute activities during the 
        remodeling process.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        <p>Remodeling of Huejotzingo Ward Church Building</p>

        <p>On October 8, 2023, Nealtican North Stake Presidency informed that the Church Area Mexico Presidency had approved the 
        remodeling of the Huejotzingo Ward Church Building in preparation for relocating all Stake activities to the new building. 
        This process will involve the creation of new spaces in the building to accommodate Stake Presidency Offices, High Council 
        and Family History Rooms, and also the enlargement of the Sacrament Room, all of which will be available in the building 
        once the remodeling activities are finished. Additional changes will be necessary to accommodate the newly created and 
        enlarged spaces, which include the relocation of the basketball yard and parking spots inside the building.</p>

        <p>Duration</p>
        <p>Due to the magnitude of the changes that the building is going to receive, it is planned that the construction 
        activities will last between 9 and 12 months. It is expected that all the construction activities will start on October 29, 2023, 
        and they will be finished between July 30 and December 30, 2024.</p>

        <p>Preparation</p>
        <p>In preparation for the remodeling process, all Ward Quorums and Organizations must empty their assigned lockers 
        in the Huejotzingo building and also ask all their organization's members to remove any personal belongings that 
        could be stored inside the building before October 29, 2023. For security reasons, access to the Huejotzingo Ward 
        building will be completely restricted once the construction activities begin.</p>

      <h3>Alternative building</h3>
      <p>
        <p>Location</p>
        <p>During the remodeling process, Huejotzingo Ward members are allowed to meet at the Ixtazihuatl Ward Building, 
        which is located in Santa Maria Atexcac Town. The distance between the 2 buildings is just 10 kilometers and 
        takes around 15 minutes to get there by car or 30 minutes using public transport. Huejotzingo Ward Sunday 
        meetings will start at 11:30 AM after Ixtazihuatl Ward finishes its own meetings. The location of the temporary 
        building can be seen by accessing the following link at Google Maps: 
        <a href="https://maps.churchofjesuschrist.org/wards/205168">Ixtazihuatl Ward | Maps (churchofjesuschrist.org)</a></p>

        <p>Special Transport on Sundays</p>
        <p>Elder's Quorum Presidency has planned to provide transport for Huejotzingo Ward members on Sundays to get 
        to the Ixtacihuatl Ward building. Shuttle buses will depart from the Huejotzingo Ward Building on Sundays 
        at 10:30 a.m. with a cost of $20 pesos per person. </p>

        <p>Restrictions</p>
        <p>Since the temporary building will be used by two wards at the same time, it is recommended to use public 
        transport to get to the Ixtazihualt building because parking spots are limited. Internet connectivity is 
        also limited due to the location of the building and the services available in Santa Maria Atexcac. Public 
        transport is available only from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Rooms inside the building are small and no air 
        conditioning is available inside the building. There won't be an office for Huejotzingo Ward leaders inside 
        the Ixtazihuatl Ward Building.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Activities during ramodeling</h3>
      <p>
        <p>Interviews</p>
        <p>Due to the existing distance between some member's homes and the Ixtazihuatl Ward, most interviews will be 
        held online using Zoom, WhatsApp, or other similar services. Appointments can be made by phone with the Executive 
        Ward Clerk. Special cases will be analyzed and addressed as required. </p>

        <p>Sport activities</p>
        <p>Sports activities can be held in public basketball courts during the remodeling process. Priesthood and 
        Auxiliary Organizations leaders need to plan these activities in advance, and they also need to be present 
        during those activities. </p>

        <p>Other activities</p>
        <p>In some cases, Priesthood and Auxiliary Organizations' activities can be held using ward members' homes when 
        possible. In these cases, the activities need to be planned in advance with the homeowner and security 
        measures need to be taken into account to avoid any risk of accident.</p>

        <p>Using Ixtazihuatl Ward Building for activities on weekdays</p>
        <p>In case the Ixtacihuatl Building facilities need to be used for a specific activity during weekdays, 
        Ward leaders need to contact Huejotzingo Bishop to coordinate such activities with the Ixtazihuatl Ward Leaders.</p>
