                <h3>Interviews</h3>
                <p>Due to the existing distance between some member's homes and the Ixtazihuatl Ward, most interviews
                    will
                    be
                    held online using Zoom, WhatsApp, or other similar services. Appointments can be made by phone with
                    the
                    Executive
                    Ward Clerk. Special cases will be analyzed and addressed as required. </p>

                <h3>Sport activities</h3>
                <p>Sports activities can be held in public basketball courts during the remodeling process. Priesthood
                    and
                    Auxiliary Organizations leaders need to plan these activities in advance, and they also need to be
                    present
                    during those activities. </p>

                <p>In some cases, Priesthood and Auxiliary Organizations' activities can be held using ward members'
                    homes
                    when
                    possible. In these cases, the activities need to be planned in advance with the homeowner and
                    security
                    measures need to be taken into account to avoid any risk of accident.</p>

                <h3>Using Ixtazihuatl Ward Building for activities on weekdays</h3>
                <p>In case the Ixtacihuatl Building facilities need to be used for a specific activity during weekdays,
                    Ward leaders need to contact Huejotzingo Bishop to coordinate such activities with the Ixtazihuatl
                    Ward
                    Leaders.</p>
