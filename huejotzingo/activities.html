        <h3>Interviews</h3>
        <p>Due to the existing distance between some member's homes and the Ixtazihuatl Ward, most interviews will be
            held online using Zoom, WhatsApp, or other similar services. Appointments can be made by phone with the
            Executive
            Ward Clerk. Special cases will be analyzed and addressed as required. </p>

        <h3>Sport activities</h3>
        <p>Sports activities can be held in public basketball courts during the remodeling process. Priesthood and
            Auxiliary Organizations leaders need to plan these activities in advance, and they also need to be present
            during those activities. </p>

        <h3>Other activities</h3>
        <p>In some cases, Priesthood and Auxiliary Organizations' activities can be held using ward members' homes when
            possible. In these cases, the activities need to be planned in advance with the homeowner and security
            measures need to be taken into account to avoid any risk of accident.</p>

        <h3>Using Ixtazihuatl Ward Building for activities on weekdays</h3>
        <p>In case the Ixtacihuatl Building facilities need to be used for a specific activity during weekdays,
            Ward leaders need to contact Huejotzingo Bishop to coordinate such activities with the Ixtazihuatl Ward
            Leaders.</p>
